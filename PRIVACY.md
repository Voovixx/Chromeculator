This data is stored either locally on your device or, if you enable the sync feature, in your own Chrome Sync account, managed by Google. We do not have access to this data.

## Currency Conversion

To provide live currency exchange rates, the extension makes requests to the open.er-api.com API. These requests do not include any user data.
